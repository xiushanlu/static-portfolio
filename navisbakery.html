        <h3>The Brief</h3>
        <p>NaVis Bakery is a beloved neighborhood bakery in Rosemead, CA‚Äîbut it had no digital footprint. No website, no SEO, no easy way for customers to find them. As part of a self-initiated outreach effort, I designed and built a custom site to capture their brand story and help them grow.<br><br>My contribution: End-to-End Project Lead (Strategy, Design, Development)</p>
        <h3>The Challenge & Guiding Principles</h3>
        <p>How could I build a digital presence for a beloved local bakery that was simple to manage, captured their warmth, and would tangibly increase their customer base? To guide the project, I set four core principles.</p>
        <div class="four-cards">
            <container>
                <h1>üè†</h1>
                <h5>Feels Like Home</h5>
                <p>The design must evoke the same feeling of warmth and craft as walking into the bakery.</p>
            </container>
            <container>
                <h1>üìà</h1>
                <h5>Drives Real-World Results</h5>
                <p>Success is measured in Google rankings, site traffic, and new customers walking through the door.</p>
            </container>
            <container>
                <h1>üåê</h1>
                <h5>Simplicity is the Ultimate Feature</h5>
                <p>Every interaction must be effortless, from finding the address to browsing the menu.</p>
            </container>
            <container>
                <h1>üí™</h1>
                <h5>Empower the Owner</h5>
                <p>The final product must be a tool the client can confidently use, not a black box they have to pay for.</p>
            </container>
        </div>
        <h3>The Process: From Research to Launch</h3>
        <h5>Step 1 ‚Äì Building a Brand Around Cravings</h5>
        <p>I started with research: reading Yelp reviews, visiting in person, and analyzing the shop‚Äôs posts. From there, I developed a look that matched their vibe‚Äîwarm browns, soft fonts, and swirl accents that felt like whipped frosting. Color and texture were core to making the site feel ‚Äúbaked with love.‚Äù</p>

            <img class="skinny" src="images/case studies/navis post.png">
        </div>
        <h5>Step 2 ‚Äì Choosing My Tech Toolbox</h5>
        <p>The most critical decision was choosing the right technology. I needed to balance ideal performance with the client's reality.</p>
        <img src="images/case studies/weight.png" class="smallImg">
        <p>This led me to WordPress + Elementor. It was a strategic trade-off. While I sacrificed the performance of a modern React framework, I delivered on the most important principle: Empower the Owner.<br><br>Tools Used: </p>

        <h5>Step 3 ‚Äì Baking Sites with Responsibility</h5>
        <p>Beyond visual design, I focused on the responsibilities that make a website truly usable and sustainable. I ensured the site was accessible (WCAG), included a clear privacy policy, and respected copyright‚Äîthen invited friends, family, and bakery staff to help test the site in the real world.<br><br>To boost performance, accessibility, and SEO, I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Compressed all images</li>
            <li>Added alt text</li>
            <li>Improved semantic structure</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="twoColumn">
            <img src="images/case studies/navis gtmetrix.png">
            <img src="images/case studies/navis google.png">
        </div>
        <p>I also added client-facing features to make the site more powerful and scalable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated Clover POS for easy menu management</li>
            <li>Connected their Instagram feed for automatic updates</li>
            <li>Created a contact form for inquiries</li>
            <li>Set up a marketing popup to collect emails for future promotions</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="twoColumn">
            <img src="images/case studies/navis clover.png">

            <img src="images/case studies/navis promo.png">
        </div>
        <h3>The Results: Real-World Impact</h3>
        <p>The website launched and immediately began delivering on its primary goal.</p>

                    <h3>Jose Vivas</h3>
                    <h5>Owner, NaVis Bakery</h5>
                    <p>When we decided to build a website for NaVis Bakery, I knew it had to be something special ‚Äî something that truly represented who we are as a family-run Mexican bakery with big dreams. Xiushan took that vision and brought it to life better than I ever imagined.
                    <br><br>
                    She built our entire website from scratch, and from day one, she was incredibly professional, organized, and easy to work with. Every question I had, she answered quickly and clearly. Every change I requested ‚Äî whether big or small ‚Äî she handled with patience and precision. She respected every milestone and always delivered on time, which made the whole process stress-free for me, even while running the bakery full-time.
                    <br><br>
                    What stood out most was how much she cared about getting it right. The site is clean, beautiful, and easy to use ‚Äî both on desktop and mobile ‚Äî and it really captures the warmth and culture behind our brand. Our customers have complimented it more than once, and I‚Äôve had other business owners ask who built it.
                    <br><br>
                    Working with Xiushan didn‚Äôt just give us a great website ‚Äî it gave us a real digital presence that helped take our business to the next level. I‚Äôm genuinely grateful for her work and would recommend her to anyone looking for someone reliable, talented, and committed to doing things the right way.

        <h3>Final Reflections</h3>
        <p>This was my first real-world client project, and it taught me how to communicate, design within constraints, and ship something useful. It cemented my belief that thoughtful technology ‚Äî no matter the stack ‚Äî can have a profound impact on real people and real businesses.<br><br>Since then, I‚Äôve been diving deeper into accessibility and performance using Next.js, Tailwind, and Framer Motion ‚Äî tools that give me full control when the project calls for it.</p>
